# flappstore

The idea is like the Apple App Store, where people buy an app for 99 cents, but based on people getting apps for free, and then flattring the author if they like the app.

We need a search screen with:

* staff pick
* search
* categories

We need a user history with apps:

* most used since last flattr

We need a dev control panel where you can add in 5apps 'public app page' links
